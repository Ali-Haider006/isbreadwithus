## Current Architecture

### Routes Established
1. **`/register`** - User registration for meetup attendees (ordinary users)
2. **`/feedback`** - Feedback submission for registered users
3. **`/sign-in`** - Admin authentication and access portal

### Tech Stack Preferences
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Design System**: Modern, clean, accessible UI components
- **Color Scheme**: Primary `#3a4095`, complemented by neutral grays and whites
- **Icons**: Lucide React library
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach

---

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: Modern, welcoming, community-focused
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with clear hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace for breathing room
- **Components**: Rounded corners (rounded-lg, rounded-full for buttons)
- **Effects**: Subtle hover states, smooth transitions
- **Shadows**: Soft shadows for depth (shadow-md, shadow-lg)

### Color Usage
- **Primary Actions**: `bg-[#3a4095]` with white text
- **Hover States**: Slightly darker `#2d3275` or lighter `#5a60b5`
- **Backgrounds**: `bg-gray-50` for pages, `bg-white` for cards
- **Text**: `text-gray-700` for body, `text-gray-900` for headings
- **Accents**: Use primary color for links, icons, and emphasis

### Component Patterns
- **Buttons**: `rounded-full` with padding `px-6 py-2` or `px-8 py-3`
- **Cards**: White background with `shadow-md` and `rounded-lg`
- **Forms**: Clear labels, proper spacing, validation states
- **Navigation**: Sticky navbar with shadow
- **Footer**: Multi-column layout with brand consistency

### Meetup Event
- Title, date, time, location
- Book being discussed
- Description/agenda
- Maximum capacity
- Registration deadline
- Attendee list

### Feedback

---

## Development Principles

### Code Quality
- **Clean Code**: Descriptive variable names, commented where necessary
- **Reusability**: Create reusable components for common UI patterns
- **State Management**: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) appropriately
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and fallbacks
- **Validation**: Client-side form validation before submission

### Best Practices
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Optimize images, lazy loading where appropriate
- **Security**: Sanitize inputs, secure admin routes, protect sensitive data
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags, descriptive alt text for images
- **Testing**: Consider edge cases and user error scenarios

## When Building Features

### Always Include:
1. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
2. **Loading States**: Show spinners or skeletons while data loads
3. **Error States**: Display helpful error messages
4. **Empty States**: Show friendly messages when no data exists
5. **Success Feedback**: Confirm when actions complete successfully
6. **Accessibility**: Proper labels, contrast, focus states

### Always Avoid:
1. **localStorage/sessionStorage**: Not supported in Claude artifacts (use React state)
2. **Hardcoded Data**: Use state or props for dynamic content
3. **Inline Styles**: Use Tailwind classes instead
4. **External Dependencies**: Only use available libraries (Lucide, Recharts, etc.)
5. **Over-formatting**: Keep text natural, avoid excessive bullet points unless requested

## Common Request Patterns

### "Create a [feature]"
- Ask clarifying questions if needed (data structure, user flow)
- Design with mobile-first approach
- Include all states (loading, error, success, empty)
- Match brand colors and design system
- Consider admin vs user access levels

### "Add functionality to [existing feature]"
- Review existing code structure
- Maintain consistency with current patterns
- Update state management as needed
- Test interaction with other features

### "Design a [page/component]"
- Follow established visual style
- Include navigation (navbar/footer) if full page
- Use appropriate spacing and typography
- Add micro-interactions (hover, focus states)
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

3. **Build** complete, functional components (not placeholders)
4. **Consider** both user and admin perspectives
5. **Include** proper error handling and edge cases
6. **Make** it mobile-responsive by default
7. **Use** React artifacts for interactive components
8. **Avoid** localStorage/sessionStorage (use React state instead)
9. **Keep** formatting minimal and natural unless I request lists/structure
10. **Ask** clarifying questions if requirements are ambiguous
